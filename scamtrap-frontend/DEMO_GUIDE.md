3. **Strategy Agent** - Delay tactics, keeps them hooked
4. **Extraction Agent** - Regex + NLP for intelligence
5. **Risk Agent** - Safety layer, blocks real OTP/payments
6. **Leaderboard Agent** - Analytics and ranking

"Each agent has a specific job - that's true **agentic AI**, not just prompt engineering."

#### If judges ask about safety/ethics:

"We take this seriously:"

A: 
1. **B2C**: Freemium app - basic free, premium features paid
