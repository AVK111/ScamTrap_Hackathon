## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Scammers cost Indians ₹1000+ crores annually. We built ScamTrap AI - an autonomous system with 6 AI agents that impersonate victims, engage scammers, and waste their time.

Our secret weapon? **Adaptive personalities**. For bank scams, AI acts like an old uncle. For job scams, a desperate graduate. 

Result? We've already wasted over **3 hours** of scammer time in testing. Scale to millions of users, and we disrupt the economics of scamming entirely."

## 🏆 Judge Questions & Answers

### "How is this different from a chatbot?"
"Great question! Traditional chatbots follow scripts. We have **6 autonomous agents** - each with specific jobs. The Persona Agent creates identities, Strategy Agent plans delays, Risk Agent ensures safety. They work together like a team, not a single bot."

### "Can scammers detect it's AI?"
"That's our innovation - **Adaptive Personality Engine**. We don't use one voice. Bank scams get an old uncle persona. Crypto scams get a skeptical engineer. Each is believable in context."

### "What's the business model?"
"Three revenue streams:
1. **B2C**: Freemium app
2. **B2B**: License to banks/telecoms
3. **B2G**: Government cybercrime units

Plus anonymized intelligence data to security firms."

### "Scalability?"
"Each conversation is autonomous - no human needed. One server handles 100+ simultaneous engagements. With container orchestration, we can scale to millions."

### "Legal/ethical concerns?"
"We take this seriously:
- All personas are fake
- No real data shared
- Only responds to forwarded messages (user consent)
- Data format ready for law enforcement
- **Ethical Mode** indicator always visible"
